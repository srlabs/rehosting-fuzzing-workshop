# Workshop: Fuzzing rehosted network services

by Marc "vanHauser" Heuse, SRLabs

## Introduction

When performing embedded pentesting, a common problem is assessing network
services for security vulnerabilities - as these are the high risk entry points
into the device.

Besides reverse engineering the binaries through various means and assisting
tools, fuzzing can be used too to uncover vulnerabilties.

Knowledge on how to do this is scarce and hence we have created this workshop
based on a real-world scenario.

## How-to

Read the slides [rehosting-fuzzing-workshop.pdf](rehosting-fuzzing-workshop.pdf)
and use the [COMMANDS.md](COMMANDS.md) text file to easily copy-paste commands.

**NOTE** This material is meant to support an interactive workshop, the slides
will not be enough to follow along!

Enjoy!
